# Election Analysis

## Project Overview

### Purpose
To use python to make an analysis of a dataset(.csv) of election results and printing the result to the terminal and a text file by using
- for loops
- if statements
- csv.reader
- .write
- etc.

### Background
A Colorado Board of Elections employeee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.
1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who recieved votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate recieved.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code 1.70.2

## Summary
There are multiple ways the scripts can be modified for use in other elections. First, the different election races can be made into a column itself so we can view results of multiple elections at once. Second, other columns such as state, party affiliation, etc can be made if we wanted to scale up to bigger elections.
